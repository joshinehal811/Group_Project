Since our dataset contains over 150,000 rows, we used a random sample of 25,000 - 30,000 rows for the clustering portion.

For this code file, "Clustering_(DB_K_Proto)_Insy695.ipynb" the dataset used is called animal_df, which is stored in the dataset folder. Furthermore, we have used this dataset, "kprototypes_clusters.csv" to explore the best-performing cluster. This dataset can be found in the "Dataset with Cluster Labels" folder, which is stored in the "Datasets" folder
